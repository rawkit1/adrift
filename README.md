The Bible of Worlds Adrift\
This is a work-in-progress site listing basically all the information available for Worlds Adrift.
Most of the work here is done in collaboration with the Worlds Adrift Science Discord group, and it couldn't be done without them fine folks.
Please note I bear no rights to the game Worlds Adrift, which is owned by Bossa Studios Ltd.
